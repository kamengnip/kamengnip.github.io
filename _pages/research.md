Research Interests
------
* Algorithm design and analysis for <b><i>operations research/operations management</i></b> problems with practical applications.
  * Business analytics and revenue management:
     * Assortment optimization, pricing optimization under discrete choice models.
     * Addressing challenges in realistic settings, including competitive, cooperative, robust, or data-driven environments.
  * Combinatorial optimization:
     * scheduling, knapsack, routing, particularly for problems with linear constraints.
  * Approximation algorithms and computational complexity.

Overall, my research pursuits aim to bridge the gap between theory and real-world applications, enabling practical solutions and advancements in the fields of operations research and operations management.
