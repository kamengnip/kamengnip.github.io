I am currently an associate professor at the College of Management, Shenzhen University. My educational journey began in Macau SAR, China, where I received my elementary education in my hometown. Later, I pursued my B.Sc. degree at Fudan University in Shanghai, China, and subsequently completed my M.Sc. and Ph.D. at Tsinghua University in Beijing, China.

My primary research interests center around designing and analyzing algorithms for real-life optimization problems in operations research and management science with applications. I focus on the problems in revenue management, resource allocation, and transportation. Recently, I have developed a keen interest in exploring problems within competitive or data-driven environments.
